I study the origins of avian diversity, primarily by examining populations in the early stages of speciation. Most of my research takes advantage of large comparative datasets, such as those that are available at natural history collections. Examining many species simultaneously reveals concordance indicating the importance of shared events, but also reveals discordance that might tell us about how species-specific traits shape their responses to the same events. I use new technologies to obtain genetic data from across the genome and also examine morphological, ecological, and distributional data.

*Key words: Comparative phylogeography, avian phylogenetics, population genomics, macroecology, field ornithology*

## My specific research interests include:

* The use of genomic data in systematics

* Examining causes of phylogeographic discordance across species

* Relating phylogeography to macroevolution

## My Background:

Originally from New Hampshire, I developed a passion for birds early, and spent most of my teenage years trying to find new and rare birds everywhere I went. My first real research experiences were during my undergraduate career at Cornell University, where I benefitted from interaction with many great researchers with diverse interests at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Through some inspiring courses and professors, I fell in love with evolutionary biology and especially speciation and macroevolution. The drive to find new birds, however, led me deeper into the Neotropics, where the diversity and complexity of the avifauna captivated me. I am incredibly grateful that I am able to pursue my two passions - avian diversity and evolutionary biology - in my research career.
