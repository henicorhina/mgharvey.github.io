I study the origins of avian diversity, primarily by examining populations in the early stages of speciation. Most of my research takes advantage of large comparative datasets, such as those that can be collected from natural history collections. I am always looking for new types of data and tools - currently, I use emerging technologies to obtain genetic data from across the genome and also examine morphological, ecological, and distributional data.

*Key words: Comparative phylogeography, avian phylogenetics, population genomics, macroecology, field ornithology*

## My specific research interests include:

* **Avian plumage evolution within and among species**

Birds have varied and spectacular plumages, but the source of this diversity is still largely unknown. Do plumage differences between species originate from variation within species? At what rates do different plumage characters, such as color or pattern, change through evolutionary time? I am addressing these questions by applying digital imagery and computer vision technologies to specimens housed at natural history collections. 

* **Comparative analyses of population genetic structure**

Some species contain remarkable variation across their distributions, whereas others are similar from place to place. The extent to which these differences are random or are a result of differences among species in traits is largely unknown. I am examining trait-dependence in geographic variation using population genetic data combined with ecological trait data. Population genetic data allow us to examine not only patterns of geographic variation, but also to estimate the impact of traits on the processes responsible for geographic differentiation, such as gene flow and natural selection. I am particularly interested in how the habitat associations of species impact differentiation.

* **Relating population-level patterns to macroevolution**

Although diversity within species varies widely, this variation may or may not persist over long evolutionary timescales to impact trends in species diversity. I combine population genetic data on intraspecific diversity with phylogenetic data on species diversity through time to assess links between diversity across timescales. If population-level patterns persist to macroevolutionary timescales, this supports the potential importance of processes at work within species in shaping organismal diversity across space and time. 

* **The use of genomic data in systematics**

New DNA sequencing technologies are able to produce massive amounts of genetic data, but their application to research in systematics is in its infancy. I have been working to develop and test approaches for obtaining data appropriate for systematics. The method I have focused on is sequence capture of ultraconserved elements. <a href="http://www.ultraconserved.org" target="_blank">Ultraconserved elements</a> are parts of the genome shared by widely divergent species - this conservation facilitates alignment of homologous sequences and adjacent variable regions provide information for comparative study. I have also been working with RAD-Seq datasets and have been developing bioinformatics pipelines and analytical tools for dealing with the massive amount of genetic data obtained using these methods.

## My Background:

Originally from New Hampshire, I developed a passion for birds early, and spent most of my teenage years trying to find new and rare birds everywhere I went. My first research experiences were while I was an undergraduate at Cornell University, where I benefitted from interaction with many great researchers with diverse interests at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Through some inspiring courses and professors, I fell in love with evolutionary biology and especially speciation and macroevolution. The drive to find new birds, however, led me deeper into the Neotropics, where the diversity and complexity of the avifauna captivated me. I am incredibly grateful that I am able to pursue my two passions - avian diversity and evolutionary biology - in my research career.
