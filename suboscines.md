As part of collaborative, NSF-funded project on suboscine birds (Aves; Passeriformes; Tyranni), we are working to estimate a comprehensive phylogeny of all currently recognized suboscine taxa and distinct forms and use this to refine classification and reconstruct diversification in the group. This new phylogeny will serve as a key resource for researchers from diverse disciplines and conservationists working to identify and save distinct or evolutionarily important populations.

<br />


# Taxonomy
***

<br />
Our initial set of target species and subspecies is based on the 2021 version of the <a href="https://www.birds.cornell.edu/clementschecklist/download/" target="_blank">eBird/Clements checklist</a>. To this, we are adding other undescribed taxa, distinct forms, and disjunct populations with the goal of sampling every distinct evolutionary unit within the group. If you are aware of populations or forms that may have been overlooked but merit inclusion, please feel free to <a href="mailto:mgh272@gmail.com" target="_blank">contact us</a>. Our current list of forms (as of October 2022) is <a href="https://mgharvey.github.io/docs/suboscine_taxa.xlsx" target="_blank">here (downloadable Excel file)</a>.


# Sampling
***

<br />
This project would be impossible without a strong collaborative effort across countries and institutions. Through this network, we have been able to identify genetic samples from nearly all target populations. That said, some of the samples are from old or degraded material. If you are aware of new genetic material or data from a population you think may be poorly represented, please <a href="mailto:mgh272@gmail.com" target="_blank">contact us</a>. Also, as of October 2022, we are still entirely lacking material for the following taxa (please contact us if you are aware of any):

| Taxon/Form  | Range | Type Locality |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Smithornis sharpei sharpei | Bioko (Gulf of Guinea) | Mt. Ysabel, 4000 feet, Fernando Po. Col. pi., Ibis, 1903, pi. 7. |
| Erythropitta rufiventris bernsteini | Gebe I. (east of Halmahera) | Gebe. |
| Hydrornis soror douglasi | Hainan I. (Seven Finger Mountains) | Seven Finger Mountains, Hainan. |
| Pitta maxima morotaiensis | Morotai I. (n Moluccas) | Minoe-Minoe Ajer, Morotai. |
| Myrmotherula assimilis transamazonica | Amazonian Brazil, along the Amazon River in extreme western Pará (east to the mouth of the Tapajós River) | Urucurituba, Rio Amazon (opposite Santarém), State of Pará, Brazil |
| Scytalopus krabbei | Known from 5 localities in 3 widely separated areas in the Central Andes of north-central Peru: Cordillera Colán in Amazonas (5.597°S, 78.245°W and approximately 5.55°S, 78.32°W); the type locality (Cerro Patricia) in northern San Martín near the Amazonas border (5.723°S, 77.754°W); and central Huánuco at Bosque Unchog (9.737°S, 76.170°W) and between Zapatagocha and Huaylaspampa (9.769°S, 76.085°W) | Peru: San Martín/Amazonas border: east slope of Cerro Patricia, ~22 km ENE of Florida, Camp Buena Vista Social Club, Bosque de Proteccion Alto Mayo, coordinates: 5.723°S, 77.754°W, elevation: 2,975 m |
| Scytalopus whitneyi | known from 2 geographically separate populations. One population is in eastern Ayacucho south of Río Mantaro and is known from: Huisca (12.832°S, 73.923°W), 9.5 km SE Pacobamba near Anco (13.099°S, 73.693°W), 5.0 km NW Chungui (13.186°S, 73.651°W), Chupón (13.243°S, 73.514°W), and Yanacocha (13.255°S, 73.522°W). The other population occurs in Apurímac between the Río Apurímac and Río Pampas and is known from the following localities, all within 26 km of Abancay: Ccocha (13.484°S, 72.982°W), near Huanipaca road (13.500°S, 72.932°W), Cerro Turronmocco (type locality, also referred to as Huanipaca road) (13.518°S, 72.888°W), almost throughout Bosque de Ampay including at Laguna Angascocha (13.593°S, 72.881°W), Las Cuevas (13.586°S, 72.886°W), and 7 km  N Abancay (13.570°S, 72.886°W), near the pass on the main road above Abancay (13.583°S, 72.838°W), 2 forests on Cerro Queñua Khasa near Runtacocha (13.6775°S, 72.7929°W and 13.6768°S, 72.7826°W), Quebrada Balcón (13.7033°S, 72.7058°W), and at 2 sites in Quebrada Chua: on the south slope of Cerro Casiniso (13.7635°S, 72.6836°W) and at Laguna Pumacocha (13.7538°S, 72.6782°W). From Krabbe et al. 2020 (The Auk) | Peru: depto. Apurímac: mountains north-northeast of Abancay: Cerro Turronmocco, coordinates: 13.518°S, 72.888°W, elevation: 3,500 m |
| Scytalopus frankeae | known from 2 geographically separate populations. The northern population is known from 3 areas in Huánuco and Pasco: the type locality above Millpo, Huánuco (occasionally spelled Milpo; originally thought to be located in Pasco and near the border between the 2 departments; 9.894°S, 75.747°W); Pagancho, Huánuco (“Huánuco Mts.”; presumed to be in the vicinity of Laguna Parguincha: 9.968°S, 76.131°W) and above Schismay (also in “Huánuco Mountains;” approximately 9.971°S, 76.166°W); and, Chipa, Pasco (approximately 10.7°S, 75.9°W). The southern population is found in Junín at the following known localities: Maraynioc (approximately 11.35°S, 75.45°W), Río Satipo near Toldopampa (11.487°S, 74.886°W to 11.531°S, 74.943°W), Apaya-Andamarca road (11.545°S, 74.811°W), Runatullo (11.646°S, 74.960°W), 12.8 km after the fork to Acobamba (11.673°S, 74.881°W), and Chilifruta (also known as “approximately 5 km WSW of Lampa”; 11.990°S, 74.935°W). The northern limit of the species’ distribution coincides with the Río Huallaga, north of which S. altirostris replaces S. frankeae at similar elevations. The southern limit coincides with Río Mantaro, south of which S. frankeae is replaced at similar elevations by the new species from Ayacucho and Apurímac described below. S. frankeae is recorded at elevations of 3,400–4,200 m and replaced at lower elevations and in adjacent forest and shrubbery by S. acutirostris. From Krabbe et al. 2020 (The Auk) | Peru: Huánuco: Maria, Millpo, LSU field camp on the trail from Pozuzo to Chaglla, coordinates: 9.894°S, 75.747°W, elevation: 3,675 m |
