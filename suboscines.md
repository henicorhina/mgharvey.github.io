As part of collaborative, NSF-funded project on suboscine birds (Aves; Passeriformes; Tyranni), we are working to estimate a comprehensive phylogeny of all currently recognized suboscine taxa and distinct forms and use this to refine classification and reconstruct diversification in the group. This new phylogeny will serve as a key resource for researchers from diverse disciplines and conservationists working to identify and save distinct or evolutionarily important populations.

<br />


# Taxonomy
***

<br />
Our initial set of target species and subspecies is based on the 2021 version of the <a href="https://www.birds.cornell.edu/clementschecklist/download/" target="_blank">eBird/Clements checklist</a>. To this, we are adding other undescribed taxa, distinct forms, and disjunct populations with the goal of sampling every distinct evolutionary unit within the group. If you are aware of populations or forms that may have been overlooked but merit inclusion, please feel free to <a href="mailto:mgh272@gmail.com" target="_blank">contact us</a>. Our current list of forms (as of October 2022) is <a href="https://mgharvey.github.io/docs/suboscine_taxa.xlsx" target="_blank">here (downloadable Excel file)</a>.


# Sampling
***

<br />
This project would be impossible without a strong collaborative effort across countries and institutions. Through this network, we have been able to identify genetic samples from nearly all target populations. That said, some of the samples are from old or degraded material. If you are aware of new genetic material or data from a population you think may be poorly represented, please <a href="mailto:mgh272@gmail.com" target="_blank">contact us</a>. Also, as of October 2022, we are still entirely lacking material for the following taxa (please contact us if you are aware of any):

| Taxon/Form  | Range | Type Locality |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Smithornis sharpei sharpei | Bioko (Gulf of Guinea) | Mt. Ysabel, 4000 feet, Fernando Po. Col. pi., Ibis, 1903, pi. 7. |
| Erythropitta rufiventris bernsteini | Gebe I. (east of Halmahera) | Gebe. |
