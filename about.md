I am generally interested in using comparative data from populations undergoing speciation to understand the factors responsible for diversity. My research focuses on birds from the Neotropics (Central and South America), home to the highest avian diversity on the planet. I use large comparative datasets, such as those that can be obtained from natural history collections, to understand broad patterns and to examine the deterministic factors underlying variation in the speciation process across many species. 

## My main research interests are:

* Comparative phylogeography
* Avian phylogenetics
* Population genomics
* Developing tools for comparative analysis
* Macroecology
* Field ornithology

## My Background:

Originally from New Hampshire, I developed a passion for birds early, and spent most of my teenage years trying to find new and rare birds everywhere I went. My first real research experiences were during my undergraduate career at Cornell University, where I benefitted from interaction with many great researchers with diverse interests at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Through some inspiring courses and professors, I fell in love with evolutionary biology and especially speciation and macroevolution. The drive to find new birds, however, led me deeper into the Neotropics, where the diversity and complexity of the avifauna captivated me. I am incredibly grateful that I am able to pursue my two passions - avian diversity and evolutionary biology - in my research career.
