I am generally interested in using comparative data from populations undergoing speciation to understand the factors responsible for diversity. My research focuses on birds from the Neotropics (Central and South America), home to the highest avian diversity on the planet. I use large comparative datasets, such as those that can be obtained from natural history collections, to understand broad patterns and to examine the deterministic factors underlying variation across species. 

## My main research interests are:

* Comparative phylogeography
* Avian phylogenetics
* Population genomics
* Developing tools for comparative analysis
* Macroecology
* Field ornithology
