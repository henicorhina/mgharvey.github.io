Welcome to my website. I am a postdoctoral researcher studying avian diversity in the lab of <a href="https://derryberrylab.wordpress.com/people/" target="_blank">Liz Derryberry</a> at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville. I have a long-term interest in linking microevolutionary processes within species to broad patterns of diversity across the globe. I combine field work and natural history collections with diverse genomic and bioinformatic toolsets to obtain data for comparative genomic, population genetic, phylogeographic, and phylogenetic analyses.
