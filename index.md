Welcome to my website. I am an ornithologist and evolutionary biologist with a long-term interest in linking evolutionary processes at the population level with broader dynamics of species diversity across time, space, and organismal groups. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher studying tropical avian diversity in the lab of <a href="https://derryberrylab.wordpress.com/people/" target="_blank">Liz Derryberry</a> at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville.
