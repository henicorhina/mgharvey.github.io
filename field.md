Field work is one of my passions. There are few feelings comparable to that of visiting a mountain range never before explored by ornithologists or floating down an Amazonian River surrounded by riotous diversity. Most of my effort on expeditions goes toward collecting museum specimens in order to maintain the natural history collections I rely on for my research. Aside from that, expeditions focus on improving taxonomic knowledge by searching for new or poorly known taxa, improving distributional knowledge by surveying poorly known regions, and adding to ecological and behavioral knowledge using standardized field observation and audio recording and by taking detailed data on specimens. My field work is focused on the Neotropics, and in particular the Amazon Basin.
